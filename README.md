### Speak through your bot

This addon lets you use the bot to speak to others. You can even send messages from another channel.

Let's assume your prefix is **!**

`!say` - Send a message to the current channel and to a different channel if specified.

       !say Hello, I am a bot.
       !say #announcements Hello from the other side.
